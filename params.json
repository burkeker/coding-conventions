For example, a news item, a species page, a featured-data-use case or a consultation request.\r\n- We use `section` in two scenarios:\r\n    - Immediately under `<body>`, a `<section>` is used to define major functional blocks of the page, e.g., banner, navigation, or footer credits. For the functional section that contains the key content of the page, we use `<main>` instead.\r\n    - Inside `<article>`, a `<section>` is used to define content blocks of an article. For example, in a species detail page, which should be an `<article>`, `<section>` is used to define classification, description or geography.\r\n- Each article and each section within an article should have an “id” unique to the page and an inline page anchor to allow linking to the article / section.\r\n- On a search results page (e.g. list of news items), the container for the result is `<main>`,  and `<article>` is used for each result;\r\n- `<aside>` is used only when the content is considered supplementary, e.g. external links. The wrapping element of `<aside>` determines at which level the content is supplementary, i.e., if `<aside>` is nested within `<article>`, it is supplementary to the article. Or if it is placed outside `<article>`, it is supplementary to the page.\r\n- For contents that have no suitable semantic element or in doubt, use `<div>` or ask.\r\n\r\n####Naming convention for CSS rules####\r\n\r\n####References####\r\n1.
